    <p>The Software Model that we have used for our project is “Waterfall Model”. We have choosen the waterfall model as it is easier to arrange tasks because we will have clearly well defined stages. For a small project like ours, which is not much complex, waterfall model is the best suited.
      The waterfall model is a sequential (non-iterative) design process, used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation and maintenance.

    <p>The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and system design is prepared. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture.
      With inputs from system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality which is referred to as Unit Testing.
